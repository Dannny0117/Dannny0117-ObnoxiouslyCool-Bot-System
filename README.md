## 🔥 Origin Story: From Mixer Memories to Multi-Platform Freedom

Back in the Mixer days, I ran a fun little bot built on ScorpBot — greeting viewers, custom commands, viewer economy, the super-fun !sin page, and all that good stuff. It was a blast while it lasted, but it was always limited by someone else's code. When Mixer shut down in 2020, that bot went with it.

Now, **I control the code 100%**. No more restrictions — I can finally add everything I always wanted: better shop integration, daily rewards, smarter automation, and true always-on reliability. Best of all, anyone can just log in (Twitch OAuth) and instantly get a working bot — no downloads, no complicated setup, no matter where you are or what your stream looks like. 24/7 greetings, thanks, custom commands, and engagement tools that keep your chat alive even when you're deep in gameplay.

This is the bot I wished existed back then — now reborn, better, and multi-platform. Let's make streaming fun again!
